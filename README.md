# BirdCallIdentifier

## Overview

This project, developed over a semester as part of the Apply AI group at AI4All, involved collaborative efforts with two peers and guidance from an AI mentor. Our objective was to utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Computer Vision techniques to accurately identify specific birdcalls from audio data. This initiative aimed to contribute to the field of ornithology by providing an efficient tool for bird species identification through their calls.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Leveraged advanced CNN architectures to process and classify audio spectrograms of birdcalls.
- **Computer Vision**: Implemented image processing techniques to convert audio signals into visual representations (spectrograms) for better analysis and identification.
- **Data Augmentation**: Employed data augmentation strategies to enhance the training dataset, ensuring robust model performance.
- **Accuracy and Precision**: Achieved high levels of accuracy in identifying bird species, demonstrating the effectiveness of the applied methodologies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the application.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Utilized for building and training the CNN models.
- **Librosa**: Used for audio processing and generating spectrograms.
- **NumPy and Pandas**: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for visualizing the spectrograms and model performance metrics.
